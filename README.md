HTML is a markup language that is used in website,apps and webpages.It informs user's computer about various elements on the code.
CSS is used for styling the pages using  fonts,sizes clour and adding annimations on your website to make it look good.
Javascript is a language that is used is create interactive website.If there are lines of code that javascript does not understand it refuses to run unlike HTML that figures out what you were trying to do and fix your mistake.
HTML formating: HTML uses tags to mark different elements, there is a opening tag <>, closing tag</>.
example of opening and closing tag on list the opening tag for list is <li> and the closing tag is</li>, some elements require both opening and closing tags while others do not require closing tag.
HTML Headline:the headlines comes in 6 different types from h1,h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6, each headline has a distinct visual effect where h1 is the largest headline and h6 is the smallest.
HTML italic and bold: we use <i> for italic and <b> for bold.
we use italic element to to apply visual italics it also goes with <em> element to add emphasis on text.they look the same visualy but they have different meaning
we also have two elements to emphisize or make something bold we use <b> to make somethimg bold visually and we use <strong> which is used to show the importance and seriousness of a point.
HTML Lists: we have three types of lists, un-ordered list,ordered list, and description  list .
Each item on the list is enclosed with <li> element.To identify the entire list and to specify its type we wrap all elements in <ul> for un-orderd list,<ol> for orderd list 
we use ordered list to indicate that there's a specific order to the items on the lis.
Definition list is used when we want to create a list that resembles a key value pair.To create definition list we use specific elements, a <dt> tag for definition term and <dd> for definition description.
HTML QOUTES:we use  <blockquote> element to quote paragraphs and <cite> element to show citations.when we want to quote a line we use inline quotes<q>.
Date elements:we use datetime attribute that helps us to speciy date or time format in a way that a computer understands.it is written like this <time datetime = year-month-day> specify the date </time>.
Time elements:we use also use the datetime element to specify time format  e.g <time datetime ="hh:mm:ss.ddd">specify the time</time>.
we can also combine date and time using datetime attribute, stating with date then time.
Subscripts , superscripts and small text: they are used when you want to mark up parts of content that have a different meaning than the rest.
Subscripts are characters that are set below the baseline of text,while superscripts are characters that are set above the baseline of text.
Class attribute:it allows us to assign reusable name to any element, it can be styled using CSS for all elements that are sharing the class.
ID attribute:it allows us to use unique name once on a HTML page, it can be used to CSS targeting and Javascript specific elements and targeted links .it ensures that there will bwe only one element with that ID 
Lang attribute : it allows us to specify the language of the content using short language code.
dir attribute: it indicates the direction in which the text flows,using "LTR" for left-to-right scripts and "RTL"for right-to-left.
Comments help in enhancing code readability and explains its purpose, comments are inserted by typing "<!--" at the start and "-->" at the end.Comments also helps to prevent confusion when the code does not funcion as expected.
in HTML elemnts can be written in uppercase and lowercase also browser support is not affected either way, so you can write with any case you want.
Non-breaking space in HTML: they tell the browser not to break the like between two words. we use "&nbs;"to insert a non-breaking space between the two names so that they stay in same line.when you add multiple spaces on HTML, browsers ignore the spaces and recognize only one but non-breaking space are not ignored by browsers if you include one you can have two spaces between words.
HTML links: when we want to create a link we use A element ,to do this we need to add href attribute with URL enclosed in quotes, the URL is where the link will take us.href is placed between the opening and the closing A tags.We can place texts, images to make them clickable.
absolute URLs they point to aprecise location on the web.
HTTP and HTTPS :"S"stand for secure it is recommended that you use HTTPS for enhanced security.
Images: to make your web not be dull you can add images , we use image element that is written as IMG,there are four attributes that need to be included for every image.
First, SRC attribute which tells the browse which image file to load
Second, ALT attribute which provides the text description of the image.
Lastly, width and height attributes which determine the size of the image.
